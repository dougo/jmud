My advice:
  Put all the .el files in a directory ~/emacs/jmud
  Put the fragment-of-.emacs in your ~/.emacs file somewhere
  Put the world-file in ~/.jmud_worlds

You might not like all of the stuff, particularly the part about where
to put the .el files--if you choose another location, fix the
reference to it in the .emacs fragment.

Note that the world file is grotesquely out of date, and serves
primarily as a mediocre syntax example at this point.
