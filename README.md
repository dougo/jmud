The great majority of the files in this repository were not written by me. I don't remember exactly when I got it
or who I got it from; my guess is I got it from Erik Ostrom circa 1992, and I've been carting it around from system
to system ever since. I hadn't used it in a few years, and discovered that it doesn't seem to work with Emacs 27,
but before I started trying to upgrade it, I figured I might as well put it into source control. So here it is.

Original README below:
======================

My advice:
  Put all the .el files in a directory ~/emacs/jmud
  Put the fragment-of-.emacs in your ~/.emacs file somewhere
  Put the world-file in ~/.jmud_worlds

You might not like all of the stuff, particularly the part about where
to put the .el files--if you choose another location, fix the
reference to it in the .emacs fragment.

Note that the world file is grotesquely out of date, and serves
primarily as a mediocre syntax example at this point.
